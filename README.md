# Implementing_and_Running_an_Initial_Coin_Offering-ICO-

**Overview-**
The ico.sol file is a Solidity smart contract that implements the ERC-20 token standard for creating and managing tokens in an Initial Coin Offering (ICO). It includes the basic functionalities required for handling token 
transfers, checking balances, and maintaining the total supply of tokens.

**Key Features-**
- *ERC-20 Standard Compliance*: Implements the standard ERC-20 functions such as totalSupply, balanceOf, and transfer, ensuring compatibility with Ethereum-based wallets and exchanges.
- *Token Distribution*: Provides mechanisms for transferring tokens between users, checking token balances, and managing token ownership.
- *Basic ICO Functionalities*: Can be used for token sales and distribution during an ICO, allowing investors to purchase and transfer tokens.

**Prerequisites-**
- *Solidity version*: >=0.5.0 <0.9.0 (recommended for compatibility).
- *Ethereum Wallet or Development Framework*: Tools like MetaMask, Truffle, or Hardhat can be used to deploy and interact with the contract.

**Installation and Deployment-**
1. *Install Solidity Tools*: Ensure that you have a Solidity-compatible environment, such as Remix IDE, Truffle, or Hardhat.
2. *Deploy the Contract*: Use a deployment script or the Remix IDE to deploy the contract on a testnet or mainnet.
3. *Interact with the Contract*: Once deployed, you can call functions like transfer, balanceOf, and totalSupply to manage tokens.

**Contract Functions-**
1. *totalSupply()*: Returns the total number of tokens in existence.
2. *balanceOf(address tokenOwner)*: Returns the number of tokens held by the specified address.
3. *transfer(address to, uint tokens)*: Transfers a specified number of tokens to another address.

**Example Usage-**
- *Checking Balance*: Call balanceOf with an address to check its token balance.
- *Transferring Tokens*: Use the transfer function to send tokens to another user.
